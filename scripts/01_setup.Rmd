# read in data


## data frame containing all moth catches in Rowardennan Rothamsted light trap 1968-2024


```{r}
daily <- read.csv("data/Rowardennan all daily data.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

### subset data to just Ecliptopera silaceata
Esil <- filter(daily, binomial == "Ecliptopera silaceata")


#make binomial (species name) a factor
Esil$binomial <- as.factor(Esil$binomial)
#convert date from character to date format
Esil$CalDate <- dmy(Esil$CalDate)
#make year variable
Esil$Year<-year(Esil$CalDate)
#make julian date variable and convert to numeric
Esil$julian <- strftime(Esil$CalDate, format = "%j")
Esil$julian<-as.numeric(Esil$julian)
```





# assigning number of flight periods to each year



## initial visualisation with heat map



### format data for heat map

```{r}
#make copy of data frame to edit
Esil2 <- Esil
##fill in blank dates in data frame and insert zeroes for absences
Esil2<-  complete(Esil2,CalDate = seq(as.Date("1968-01-01"), as.Date("2024-12-31"), "day"), fill = list(DailyCount = 0))

#add in julian day to new dates with zero abundance
Esil2$julian <- strftime(Esil2$CalDate, format = "%j")
Esil2$julian<-as.numeric(Esil2$julian)

#filter between day of year 100 and 290 for visualisation - all observations fall between these dates
Esil2<-filter(Esil2,julian>100,julian<290)

#update year variable
Esil2$Year<-year(Esil2$CalDate)

#convert back to data frame from tibble
Esil2<-as.data.frame(Esil2)

##log counts for visualisation
Esil2$logcount <- log(Esil2$DailyCount + 1)
```



### make and export heat map

```{r}
#plot heat map
heatmap<- ggplot(Esil2, aes(julian, Year, fill= logcount)) + 
  geom_tile()+
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete=FALSE, name = "Log Abundance")+
  theme_bw()+
  xlab("Day of Year")

#export heat map
ggsave(filename = "outputs/figures/assigning_n_flight_periods/E_silaceata_heat_map.png",
       plot = heatmap,
       device = "png",
       width = 18,
       height = 12,
       units = "cm",
       dpi = 300,
       bg = "white")

```



Heat map suggests two flight periods - test this using Gaussian mixture model.



## kernel density estimates



### Validate which years have one or two flight periods visually by plotting data over kernel density estimates

```{r}
#format data by creating vector where each observation is one individual moth and the value of each observation in the vector is the week of year that the individual was captured
 
#make week variable
 Esil$week <- week(Esil$CalDate)

 #make empty list
lw_all <- list()

#loop through data repeating the week of year of each catch for the corresponding number of times that there were moths captured during that week
for(i in 1:nrow(Esil)){
  lw_all[[i]] <- rep(Esil[i,12], times = Esil[i,8])
}

#convert list to vector
(vw_all<-unlist(lw_all))





##kernel density plots with vertical lines to show moth catches in each year

#convert year to factor
Esil$Year <- as.factor(Esil$Year)

#loop through each year of the data set in turn
for(x in levels(Esil$Year)){
  
  
  df <- filter(Esil, Year == x)
  df$Year <- as.character(df$Year)
  df$Year <- as.numeric(df$Year)

  #create empty list
lw_sub <- list()

#loop through each week in the data set and repeat the week for the corresponding number of moths caught during that week
for(i in 1:nrow(df)){
  lw_sub[[i]] <- rep(df[i,12], times = df[i,8])
}

#convert list to vector
(vw_sub<-unlist(lw_sub))

#create file pathway to save plots
filepathroot <- "outputs/figures/assigning_n_flight_periods/kd_mmposterior/plot"
plotnum <- x
filepath1 <- paste(filepathroot, plotnum, sep = "_")
filepath2 <- paste(filepath1, ".png", sep = "")

#make kernel density estimate using data for all years to act as base for plot
dens <- density(vw_all)

#save png
png(filepath2)
#plot kernel density for all years
plot(dens)
#add lines to kernel density for observations of individuals in each year
abline(v = vw_sub)
title(main = x)
dev.off()

}


```







## Gaussian mixture model

### statistical test for how many flight periods each year


```{r}

#gaussian mixture model assuming equal split between groups, means of week 21 and week 32, and sigma of 1
mmw <- normalmixEM(vw_all, lambda = .5, mu = c(21, 32), sigma = 1)
summary(mmw)
plot(mmw, which = 2)
 
#make data frame with posterior probability of each data point belonging to each flight period
pdfw <- as.data.frame(mmw$posterior)


#make vector for each year repeated as many times as there were moths caught in that year
ly <- list()

for(i in 1:nrow(Esil)){
  ly[[i]] <- rep(Esil[i,10], times = Esil[i,8])
}

(vy<-unlist(ly))


#add year and week to data set of posterior probabilities for each observation belonging to each flight period
pdf2$Year <- vy
pdf2$week <- vw_all

#filter to only observations with high probability of belonging to second flight period
pdf2sub <- filter(pdf2, comp.2 > 0.999)


#get list of years with high probability of two flight periods
pdf2sub$Year <- as.character(pdf2sub$Year)
pdf2sub$Year <- as.factor(pdf2sub$Year)
years_2_fp <- c(levels(pdf2sub$Year))





### make data set with year and number of flight periods

#make data frame containing all years throughout duration of data set
fpdf <- data.frame(Year = c(1968:2024))


##get annual totals to remove years where no individuals were observed - in these years we cannot be sure how many flight periods there were
annualtotals <- Esil %>% group_by(Year) %>% summarise(total = sum(DailyCount))

#remove years in which no individuals were caught
fpdf <- filter(fpdf, Year %in% annualtotals$Year)

#add number of flight periods in each year
fpdf <- mutate(fpdf, Gen = case_when(
  Year %in% years_2_fp ~ 1,
  .default = 0
))



##export data
write.csv(fpdf, "outputs/flight_periods.csv")

```
